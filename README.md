## Features:
- **AutoBuild:** Places blocks according to placement in a 5x5 grid. You can draw pictures with it! (Credits to Banana) I modified it so it places lengthways infront of you. This way you can draw stairs and place them infront of you, hop up em and keep going.
- **AutoBuildDown:** Same as above, but it places beneath your feet infront of you for downward stair building. Top right space is not reachable by the player so don't use that space in this case. (Credits to Banana)
- **AutoStaircase:** Builds stairs upward in the direction you are facing. (Credits to Frostburn, and Banana for the player centering utils to make it work correctly) I just had to fix up some stuff for this one but Frostburn had the base code there. I believe this is the first publicly available automatic staircase builder in a Meteor addon, correct me if I'm wrong maybe I didn't have to learn some Java to do this.
- **BetterScaffold:** Give you more options for scaffolding, bigger range and others. (Credits to Meteor-Tweaks)
- **Boom:** Throws entities when you click (Credits to Allah-Hack) I just added some more fun things you might want to throw.
- **ExplosionAura:** Spawns creepers at your position that explode as you move. Like a bigger, more laggy Nuker module for creative mode. The use of the module Velocity is recommended to avoid being thrown around.
- **FireballClicker:** Shoots fireballs wherever you click (Credits to GriefWaffen)
- **FireballRain+:** Rains whatever entities you desire from a list similar to Boom (Credits to Griefwaffen (Or Allah-Hack? I have reason to believe it came from there)) It used to only rain fireballs, but I didn't think that was fun enough so I added the things put in Boom.
- **HandOfGod:** Deletes the world around you as you fly. It deletes when you press forward, jump, or crouch. Operator status required.
- **Phase:** Allows you to phase through blocks vertically, and through thin blocks horizontally such as doors and world border (Credits to Meteor-Rejects) Please add this back it's not too terrible.
- **ShulkerDupe:** Duplicates the contents of a shulker when opening. Only works on Vanilla, Forge, and Fabric servers 1.19 and below. Use multiconnect or viafabric (Credits to Allah-Hack)
- **Voider:** Replaces the world from the top down (Credits to Allah-Hack) I only added options to set max and minimum height for voiding, and instead of just air it can do water and lava now too.
